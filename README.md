# QWI Experimental Schemas
Experimental QWIPU Schema files, that may or may not later be incorporated into public-use [QWI](http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data) file and content specifications.

These are NOT official publication standards of any agency. However, they may turn out to be useful.

For official LEHD-published schema, see http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/schema/

You can browse the following schemas:

* [v3.5](formats/v3.5): Simply a store (incomplete) of the previous version.
* [v4.0](formats/v4.0/lehd_public_use_schema.html): A translation of the current version in use at [http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data](http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data) for QWI.
* [v4.0.1](formats/v4.0.1/lehd_public_use_schema.html): First schema in this proposed format, including updates to geography files for R2015Q2 data releases by the Census Bureau, LEHD Program.
* [v4.0.2](formats/v4.0.2/lehd_public_use_schema.html): An update to 4.0.1 reflecting change of industry coding to NAICS 2012.

* [v4.1b-draft](formats/v4.1b-draft/lehd_public_use_schema.html): A draft version that adds variability measures
