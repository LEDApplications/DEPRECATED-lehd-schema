QWI and Job-to-Job Flow Shapefile Data  
Shapefiles used to provide mapping functionality in QWI Explorer and Job-to-Job Explorer are created by transforming input shapefiles sourced from TIGER/Line. Text below describes the inputs, transformations, and the output shapefiles.

INPUTS
Source:  TIGER/Line 2015 shapefiles (https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html).  
Input shapefiles:
tl_2015_us_state
tl_2015_us_county
tl_2015_us_cbsa
tl_2015_[ST]_place (for creation of WIA/WIB shapefile)
tl_2015_[ST]_cousub (for creation of WIA/WIB shapefile)

TRANSFORMATIONS
The following major transformations are applied to the input files:  
All geographies are reprojected to WGS-1984 Geographic Coordinate System (http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/).
Shoreline water has been clipped out to provide a more recognizable depiction of the coastlines.  
Each layer is given internal point coordinates (stored as double) based on the WGS-1984 projection (decimal degrees).
Each layer is run through a “simplify polygon” procedure to remove unnecessary complexity from the features. 
Features from Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands have been removed because they are not used current LEHD tabulations. 
Each shapefile’s attribute table has been updated to conform to the standard LEHD output format (variables_shp.csv), which consists of the following six fields: STUSPS, GEOGRAPHY, NAME, LABEL, INTPTLAT and INTPTLON.   Legal values for STUSPS can be found in label_stusps.csv.  

OUTPUTS
Output shapefiles – grouped by paired products – are listed below. Each shapefile includes specific notes on its preparation.

QWI Geographies
State (lehd_state.shp)
No transformations occur to this layer other than those listed above.
County (lehd_county.shp)
STUSPS is added to the NAME field so that county names read: "Cook, IL" for example.
CBSA - within State (lehd_stcbsa.shp) 
All features are split into state-specific CBSA features by intersecting each feature with the state shapefile features.  
The STUSPS field is added during the intersect with the state shapefile.
STFIPS (i.e. numeric nationally unique state code) is prepended to the GEOGRAPHY field to distinguish state-parts of the same CBSA (i.e. make them nationally unique). 
“([STUSPS] part)” is added to the end of the NAME field only for those CBSA features that are split by state lines.
Workforce Investment Board Areas (lehd_wib.shp)
The WIA/WIB shapefiles are built from the Place, County Subdivision, and County shapefiles from TIGER/Line based on definitions provided by the LED state partners.

Job-to-Job Flow Geographies
State (lehd_state.shp)
No transformations occur to this layer (the same state file is used for QWI and J2J applications).
CBSA - National (lehd_cbsa.shp)
The state remainder areas are added to the shapefile as new features.  They are assigned unique codes ([STUSPS]+999) and names (“Not in metro/micro area, [STUSPS]”).
